    <h2>My Experience of Lux Mundi Cup 2024</h2>
    <p>
      The Lux Mundi Cup was the biggest event of the year at our school! It felt like everyone was buzzing with excitement. 
      The opening ceremony was incredible. The stage was decorated with colorful lights and banners, and there were so many performances. <br><br>
      The music was loud, and everyone was cheering. It was like a big party, and it was so cool to see everyone from our school come together. 
      It felt like the whole week was going to be amazing!<br><br>

     I wanted to join on playing sports and I have so many sports to join onto but I decided to join the athletics. I waa veey nervous at first because I dont know anyone in the athletics team. But I encourage my classmate to join because they said are not participating in the LMC. They eventually joined and we always train everyday for the competition.<br><br>
      I was lucky to be on a team with some really great people. We worked together, practiced hard, and even though some of us didn't win, we still had a lot of fun. 
      We learned so much, and I'm glad I got to be part of it.
      The closing ceremony was a bit of a bummer. It started raining really hard, and then the lights went out. 
      I was looking forward to the last performances and the awards ceremony, but the rain just kept coming. 
      It was a little disappointing, but it didn't ruin the whole week. We had so much fun with the opening ceremony, the sports and special events, and all the other activities. 
      The Lux Mundi Cup was a great experience, and I'm already looking forward to next year.
